# Current State

Last updated: 2026-07-06

## Week 1 Status

HonoWarden is a deployable Cloudflare Workers API shell.

Implemented:

- Hono + TypeScript strict project
- Wrangler configuration for local, staging, and production environments
- D1 and R2 binding placeholders
- generated Cloudflare runtime types
- GitHub Actions CI
- Dependabot configuration
- Vitest route tests
- `GET /`
- `GET /health`
- `GET /healthz`
- `GET /api/config`
- structured JSON 404 responses
- request ID propagation
- CORS for same-origin and official extension-style origins
- basic security headers

## Week 2 Increment

Implemented:

- initial D1 migration for users, devices, refresh tokens, folders, and ciphers
- schema migration ledger
- indexes for normalized user lookup, session lookup, revision scans, and deleted cipher scans
- encrypted payload columns for vault records, with no plaintext vault fields in the schema
- `GET /health/db` for D1 availability, schema version, and required-table checks
- unit tests for migration shape, database health states, and the HTTP health route

## Week 3 Increment

Implemented:

- executable compatibility fixture directory under `compat/fixtures`
- fixture examples for prelogin KDF discovery, password grant token success, and empty vault sync
- `pnpm compat:test`
- CI coverage for compatibility fixtures

## Week 4 Increment

Implemented:

- `POST /identity/accounts/prelogin`
- email normalization and `HONOWARDEN_ALLOWED_EMAILS` allowlist parsing
- default-deny prelogin behavior
- explicit `403` responses for public registration endpoints
- regenerated Cloudflare binding types for the allowlist variable

## Week 5 Increment

Implemented:

- private `POST /api/accounts/bootstrap` operator endpoint
- default-off bootstrap flag
- bootstrap token check via request header
- allowlisted account creation using normalized email
- D1 `INSERT OR IGNORE` account creation to handle duplicate parallel bootstrap attempts
- stable `201`, `400`, `403`, `409`, and `503` bootstrap responses

## Week 6 Increment

Implemented:

- `POST /identity/connect/token` password grant
- `HONOWARDEN_TOKEN_SECRET` fail-closed token signing requirement
- normalized user lookup for password grant
- constant-time comparison for presented master password hash
- HMAC-signed access tokens
- random refresh token generation with secret-bound SHA-256 hash storage
- device upsert before refresh token persistence
- stable invalid grant, invalid request, misconfigured, and database unavailable responses

Not implemented:

- refresh token grant and rotation
- vault sync
- any storage of real password-vault data

The project remains pre-alpha and must not be used to store real secrets.
